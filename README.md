## Overview
This project is a tool to analyze paper submission information for conferences. It is basically a visualization tool combined with a backend query service.
This project is designed to enable conference program chairpersons to visualize and share conference submission statistics. By parsing information in different formats, we aim to assist users to obtain the most value  out of the information uploaded. We also support sharing and exporting of such visualization.
